*Simpsons 1/3 Algorithm
This algorithm accepts two vectors as inputs. The first is a vector containing equally spaced x values, and the second is a
vector cointaining the corresponding y values. The algoritm then estimates the value of the integral over the given region
using the Simpsons 1/3 method. If there are not enough points to use the Simpsons method for the last interval, the algorithm
uses the trapeziod method instead.
