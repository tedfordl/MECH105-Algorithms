# False Position Algorithm
This algorithm accepts a function, an upper and lower bound for the function, and desired approximate error as inputs, 
then uses the false position method to approximate the root in the given bounds. Optionally, it also can take a maximum number of 
iterations as an input, and stop once the number of iterations has been reached.
